# Style Transfer using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

 
Problem statement:

There are various types of MRI that have the ability to capture different types of abnormalities. However, one type of MRI may not be sufficient in capturing a particular type of abnormality. In this case, having another type of MRI may enhance the accuracy of a diagnosis, thus leading to better treatment of the patient.
However, gaining access to different imaging techniques is difficult and expensive. Also, doctors often prescribe one type of MRI at once, but what if you could create another type of MRI from the one that we already have? Moreover, without investing the same amount of time and money?

 
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide the luxury of creating another type of MRI from the existing one. In this project i have used a particular variant of GANs, called CycleGAN, to translate the style of one MRI image into another. This will help in gaining a better understanding and analysis of the scanned image. By using GANs, we create T2 weighted images from T1 weighted MRI images and vice-versa.
